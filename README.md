Oeson Project 2: Analyzing HR Data &amp; turning it into insightful Visualization

Problem Statement: We are Given limited HR data from a reputed organization XYZ Technologies that includes relevant information 
about the employees like ID, designation, performance score, salary, etc. As Data Scientists each intern has to make necessary
visualization from the data using Seaborn/Matplotlib, try to bring relevant inferences from the data by visualizing 
the charts between multiple columns, and state our findings with appropriate statements.

--> This is what I did here in my presentation using Python and its libraries pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
